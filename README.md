# Planti.st ðŸŒ± Capture plants and win rewards

[Planti.st](https://planti.st) is an interactive design experiment created by Sasha Iatsenia during a workshop at [ECAL](https://ecal.ch) with [Yehwan Song](https://yhsong.com/). It uses artificial intelligence to determine if you captured a plant, or if you just captured the floor for example. Once you capture three plants, you get a reward!
